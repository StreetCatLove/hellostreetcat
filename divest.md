Recently Twitch temp banned a fellow streamer for having "lesbian" in their account name, seemingly in an attempt to force them to change it. This is the latest in a long line of undeserved bans to leftist streamers including Leaping Larry, Lenin Smesh, Adrienne Vixen, and more. Its about time we #divest from a single platform and create intersectional communities on all streaming sites while adhering to <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/">BDS</a> reccomendations! 🍉

Consider taking the following actions as you are able:
* Create positive spaces for Colonized, Disabled, 2SLGBTQIA+ peoples
* Multi-stream to as many platforms as possible to maximize you reach - <a href="https://streetcatlove.github.io/hellostreetcat/multi">our OBS multi-stream guide</a>
* StreamElements is complicit in the colonization of Palestine, do not use them to process donations if at all possible. For a bot, consider using firebot.app or <a href="https://github.com/StreetCatLove/streetcat_utils/blob/main/twitch-bot.py">our DIY python bot</a>
* Do not refer to viewers as "refugees", use terms like "barbaric" or "savage" towards BIPOC people, or resort to ableist language
* Encourage viewers to support you on platforms with the least fees like ko-fi, liberapay, buymeacoffee, kick, or patreon
* Encourage viewers to support you on platforms divested from the colonization of Palestine
* Consider alteratives to stream events that may lead to viewers to support you on platforms complicit in the colonization of Palestine
* Prioritze social media posts on platforms divested from the colonization of Palestine
* Consider removing chat from your scene or have a unique scene for each platform
* Prioritize support events equally across platforms
* Prioritize chat interactions equally across platforms
* Equalize viewer points and viewer interactivity across platforms
* Display a Divest graphic on screen
* Use timers to inform viewers of #Divest
* Add a !divest command
* Add a divest pannel in your description
* Make subscriber emotes available to everyone via BTTV or 7tv
* Have a way to direct viewers to ad block tools like <a href="https://github.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions">AdSolutions</a> 
* Use a timer with the <a href="https://github.com/StreetCatLove/recs">Content Recommendation Site</a> to promote our #Divest partners, Gaza Aid Funds, and other recommended creators all at once

BDS Basics:
* <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott">BDS designates Google and Amazon as Pressure Targets</a>, reccomending "boycotts when reasonable alternatives exist, as well as lobbying, peaceful disruptions, social media pressure, strategic litigation, etc."
* Project Nimbus, the joint $1.22 billion contract between Google and Amazon signed in 2021, provides cloud computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence and other technology services to the Israeli government and the Israeli military. Nimbus offers the platform for the Israeli military to run deadly AI programs such as Lavender and Gospel – crucial to the Gaza genocide.

Follow the <a href="https://legal.twitch.com/legal/terms-of-service">Twitch TOS</a>. The simulcasting guidelines are:
* You ensure that the quality of Twitch users’ experience of your Simulcast is, at a minimum, no less than the experience on other platforms or services, including by your engagement with the Twitch community, for example, via chat.
* You do not provide links, or otherwise direct your community, to leave Twitch for your simulcast on other services because we value the community on Twitch and the integral role community engagement plays for all Twitch users.
* You do not use third-party services that combine activity from other platforms or services on your Twitch stream during your Simulcast, such as merging chat or other features, to ensure the Twitch community is included in the entirety of the experience of your livestream.

Messages from our Partners
* Mama Em Media - Hello my fellow comrades, due to the ongoing banning of our Communist and LGBTQIA+ comrades, we are starting a push to divest from Twitch. A few of us streamers have gotten together and started our own movement to finally hold Twitch to the grindstone about their clearly bigoted practices and we ask our comrades to join our movement! From the long standing permabans of Smeshy and Adrienne, through Leaping Larry, to the most recent victim of Twitch, LesbianHotSauce. We have stood here dehumanized by Twitch while larger streamers continue to help pump money into the pockets of Amazon, who actively pumps money into politics to do horrible things like, but not limited to, lobbing for transphobic policies and laws. It's time to stand up! It's time to fight back! Join out movement! Boycott, Divest, Sanction!
