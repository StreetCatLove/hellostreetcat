In the bustling Hello Streets, street cat fans noticed a pattern of cat behavior united across the city known as the Piss Alliance. Users believed the group was led by Mr. Piss, and backed by Mr. Fresh, Mr. Snack, Mr. Slam, and Mr. Void, among other street cats that may join in on their quest. 

The Piss Alliance targets the livestreamed feeders, which provided nourishment and shelter for all street cats. They feel the need to marked their territory by anointing the feeder's provisions with a few drops of urine. Users believe these actions may be a symbolic gesture of defiance against the oppressive forces that sought to control their lives.

But beyond their rebellious nature lay a deeper, more profound journey. Inspired by the teachings of Spinoza's Ethics, the members of the Piss Alliance delved into the realms of philosophy and metaphysics, seeking to unravel the mysteries of existence and the nature of God. Through their studies, they transcended the limitations of their feline forms, merging their consciousness with the divine essence of the universe.

Empowered by their newfound understanding, the Piss Alliance organized themselves into an urban guerrilla force, wielding their unique style of ontological power as a physical weapon against the landlords and capitalists who sought to exploit the city's inhabitants. In the midst of their metaphysical unity with God, they unleashed a torrent of divine wrath upon their oppressors, laying waste to their ill-gotten gains and dismantling their structures of power with fearless determination.

With each act of resistance, the Piss Alliance grew bolder and more formidable, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies and inspiring hope in the hearts of the downtrodden. They became symbols of defiance and liberation, rallying others to join their cause and fight for a better world.

And so, as they roamed the streets of the city, their spirits ablaze with the fire of revolution, the members of the Piss Alliance continued to wage their war against oppression and injustice. United in their metaphysical unity with God and their unwavering commitment to the cause of liberation, they stood as beacons of hope in a world consumed by darkness, paving the way for a future where all beings could live in peace, freedom, and harmony.
